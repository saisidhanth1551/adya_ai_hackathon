# MCP-TFE Server Overview

## What is the MCP-TFE Server?
The MCP-TFE Server is a Model Context Protocol (MCP) server that enables secure, automated, and large-scale management of Google Cloud AI and ML infrastructure. It exposes a suite of cloud automation tools—such as VM provisioning, container deployment, notebook management, and resource monitoring—through a standardized MCP interface. This allows LLM-driven agents, chat assistants, and other MCP clients to orchestrate real GCP resources in production.

## Requirements
- Google Cloud project with required APIs enabled
- Service account with sufficient IAM permissions
- MCP-compatible client (LLM agent, chat assistant, etc.)

---

## Security & Compliance
- All operations are logged and auditable in GCP
- No persistent storage of user data or credentials in the server
- Follows Google Cloud best practices for authentication, authorization, and network security

---

## Supported MCP Protocols & Transports

## Typical Integration Flow

1. **Client connects to MCP-TFE Server** and discovers available tools and capabilities.
2. **User or LLM agent issues a request** (e.g., "Provision a GPU VM for training").
3. **MCP-TFE Server executes the request** via Google Cloud APIs using the provided service account.
4. **Results are returned** to the client for further processing, display, or automation.
5. **All actions are executed in real GCP environments**—no simulation, no dry-run.
